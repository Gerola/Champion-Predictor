# Data_Mining_Project_2022

**Data Mining Task:**<br>
Take the stats for each team from the official NBA website from the past 21 years with the champions known plus the stats for this year's teams as well. Then use the stats from the past champions to get the six most similar teams for the current year, three from each conference by implementing the centered cosine similarity. From those six teams simulate a playoff series to predict the champion for that year. After this task is done, predict the stats for the following year based on stats from the previous three seasons and do the same task, get six teams using the centered cosine similarity with past champions, predict the champion from those six teams through a playoff series and arrive at a predicted champion. With the output being the final six teams along with the predicted champion for both the current and preceding year. With a percentage to indicate how confident the future champion is present in the final six and how confident the predicted champion is going to be the champion for the given year.
    
**Questions Looking to Investigate:**<br>
	1. How accurate is the centered cosine similarity when it comes to sports, i.e. how reliable is it to help predict the champion for a season?<br>
	2. Can stats alone be used to predict the champion for a year and following years?<br>

**Challenges Faced to Solve this Task:**<br>
	1. How to simulate a playoff series to determine the champion with the final six teams after the filtering process?<br>
	2. How to filter out teams for the playoff simulation?<br>
	3. How to determine the stats for the following year (2022-2023 season)?<br>
	4. How to get a confidence number when making the prediction for future champions?<br>
