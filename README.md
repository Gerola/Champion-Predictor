    +/- - What this stat means is when a player comes in their +/- is at zero and when they go out of the game the total change 
            in points is their +/- and this is the team average 
            Example:
                The player comes in at score 15:20
                and goes out of the game at 35:35
                The +/- would be at a 5 since the total change in points was 5 and positive since
                the team gained points on the opposing team.
